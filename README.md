## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram
 - Messaging with friends
 - Temporary stories

Youtube
 - The thumbnails
 - Comment sections

Tiktok
 - Comments
 - Engaging algorithm

I'd like to build an app that will utilize features like comments or messaging with friends/other people. The key to a social app is obviously implementing a good way to interact with others, so I want to build one where people can talk with each other about a specific topic. Letterboxd does a good job at this where film lovers can get together and make conversation about their favorite and least favorite movies. I hope to either improve this or make something similar focused on another topic. I would want to add features like uploading videos and anything to improve communication for users.

## Notes

I have never used Swift before, so learning the new syntax was the main challenge for this app. But after a bit of research/googling, I was able to figure it out.
